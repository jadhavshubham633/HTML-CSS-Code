        <div class="about">
            <p>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (14 April 1891 – 6 December 1956) was an Indian <a href="#">jurist, economist</a>, social reformer and political leader who headed the committee drafting the <a href="#">Constitution of India</a> from the <a href="#">Constituent Assembly debates</a>, served as <a href="#">Law and Justice minister</a> in the <a href="#">first cabinet</a> of <a href="#">Jawaharlal Nehru</a>, and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement after renouncing <a href="#">Hinduism</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After graduating from <a href="#">Elphinstone College, University of Bombay</a>, Ambedkar studied economics at 
                <a href="#">Columbia University</a> and the <a href="#">London School of Economics</a>, receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923, respectively, and was among a handful of Indian students to have done so at either institution in the 1920s.[13] He also trained in the law at Gray's Inn, London. In his early career, he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for partition, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for <a href="#">Dalits</a>, and contributing to the establishment of the state of India. In 1956, he converted to <a href="#">Buddhism</a>, initiating mass conversions of Dalits.[14]</p>
                <br>
                <p>In 1990, the <a href="#">Bharat Ratna</a>, India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred on Ambedkar. The salutation <a href="#">Jai Bhim</a> (lit. "Hail Bhim") used by followers honours him. He is also referred to by the nickname <a href="#">Babasaheb (BAH-bə SAH-hayb)</a>, meaning "Respected Father".</p>

    <h1>Early Life</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military cantonment of Mhow (now officially known as Dr Ambedkar Nagar) (now in <a href="#">Madhya Pradesh</a> ).[15] He was the 14th and last child of <a href="#">Ramji Maloji Sakpal,</a> an army officer who held the rank of <a href="#">Subedar,</a> and Bhimabai Sakpal, daughter of Laxman Murbadkar.[16] His <a href="#">family</a> was of <a href="#">Marathi</a> background from the town of <a href="#">Ambadawe (Mandangad taluka)</a> in <a href="#">Ratnagiri district</a> of modern-day <a href="#">Maharashtra.</a> Ambedkar was born into a <a href="#">Mahar</a> (dalit) caste, who were treated as untouchables and subjected to socio-economic discrimination.[17] Ambedkar's ancestors had long worked for the army of the <a href="#">British East India Company,</a> and his father served in the British Indian Army at the Mhow cantonment.[18] Although they attended school, Ambedkar and other untouchable children were segregated and given little attention or help by teachers. They were not allowed to sit inside the class. When they needed to drink water, someone from a higher caste had to pour that water from a height as they were not allowed to touch either the water or the vessel that contained it. This task was usually performed for the young Ambedkar by the school peon, and if the peon was not available then he had to go without water; he described the situation later in his writings as "No peon, No Water".[19] He was required to sit on a gunny sack which he had to take home with him.</p>
    
    <p>Ramji Sakpal retired in 1894 and the family moved to <a href="#"> Marathi Brahmin</a> two years later. Shortly after their move, Ambedkar's mother died. The children were cared for by their paternal aunt and lived in difficult circumstances. Three sons – Balaram, Anandrao and Bhimrao – and two daughters – Manjula and Tulasa – of the Ambedkars survived them. Of his brothers and sisters, only Ambedkar passed his examinations and went to high school. His original surname was Sakpal but his father registered his name as Ambadawekar in school, meaning he comes from his native village 'Ambadawe' in Ratnagiri district.[21][22][23][24] His Marathi Brahmin teacher, Krishnaji Keshav Ambedkar, changed his surname from 'Ambadawekar' to his own surname 'Ambedkar' in school records.[25][26][27][28][29]</p>

                <h3>Post-secondary education</h3>
                <p>In 1897, Ambedkar's family moved to Mumbai where Ambedkar became the only untouchable enrolled at <a href="#">Elphinstone High School.</a> In 1906, when he was about 15 years old, he married a nine-year-old girl, Ramabai. The match was <a href="#">arranged</a> by the couple's parents, in accordance with prevailing custom at that time.[30]</p>
            </div>
        </section>
        <h3>Studies at the University of Bombay</h3>
        <p>In 1907, he passed his matriculation examination and in the following year he entered <a href="#">Elphinstone College,</a> which was affiliated to the <a href="#">University of Bombay,</a> becoming, according to him, the first from his Mahar caste to do so. When he passed his English fourth standard examinations, the people of his community wanted to celebrate because they considered that he had reached "great heights" which he says was "hardly an occasion compared to the state of education in other communities". A public ceremony was evoked, to celebrate his success, by the community, and it was at this occasion that he was presented with a biography of the Buddha by Dada Keluskar, the author and a family friend.[31]</p>
        <p>By 1912, he obtained his degree in economics and political science from Bombay University, and prepared to take up employment with the Baroda state government. His wife had just moved his young family and started work when he had to quickly return to Mumbai to see his ailing father, who died on 2 February 1913.[32]</p>

            <div class="about">
                <h3>Studies at Columbia University</h3>
                <p>In 1913, at the age of 22, Ambedkar was awarded a Baroda State Scholarship of £11.50 (Sterling) per month for three years under a scheme established by <a href="#">Sayajirao Gaekwad III </a>(Gaekwad of Baroda) that was designed to provide opportunities for postgraduate education at Columbia <a href="#">University</a> in New York City. Soon after arriving there he settled in rooms at <a href="#">Livingston Hall</a> with Naval Bhathena, a Parsi who was to be a lifelong friend. He passed his M.A. exam in June 1915, majoring in economics, and other subjects of Sociology, History, Philosophy and Anthropology. He presented a thesis, Ancient Indian Commerce. Ambedkar was influenced by John Dewey and his work on democracy.[33]</p>
            </div>
        </section>
        <p>In 1916, he completed his second master's thesis, National Dividend of India – A Historic and Analytical Study, for a second M.A.[34] On 9 May, he presented the paper <a href="#">Castes in India: Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development</a> before a seminar conducted by the anthropologist <a href="#">Alexander Goldenweiser</a>. Ambedkar received his Ph.D. degree in economics at Columbia in 1927.[13]</p>

In June 1917, he returned to India because his scholarship from Baroda ended. His book collection was dispatched on a different ship from the one he was on, and that ship was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine.[32] He got permission to return to London to submit his thesis within four years. He returned at the first opportunity, and completed a master's degree in 1921. His thesis was on "The problem of the rupee: Its origin and its solution".[35] In 1923, he completed a D.Sc. in Economics which was awarded from <a href="#">University of London,</a> and the same year he was called to the Bar by Gray's Inn.[13]</p>

            <div class="about">
                
                <p>As Ambedkar was educated by the <a href="#">Princely State of Baroda,</a> he was bound to serve it. He was appointed Military Secretary to the Gaikwad but had to quit in a short time. He described the incident in his autobiography, <a href="#">Waiting for a Visa.</a>[36] Thereafter, he tried to find ways to make a living for his growing family. He worked as a private tutor, as an accountant, and established an investment consulting business, but it failed when his clients learned that he was an untouchable.[37] In 1918, he became professor of political economy in the <a href="#">Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics</a> in Mumbai. Although he was successful with the students, other professors objected to his sharing a drinking-water jug with them.[38]</p>
                <p>Ambedkar had been invited to testify before the <a href="#">Southborough Committee,</a> which was preparing the <a href="#">Government of India Act 1919.</a> At this hearing, Ambedkar argued for creating separate electorates and reservations for untouchables and other religious communities.[39] In 1920, he began the publication of the weekly Mooknayak (Leader of the Silent) in Mumbai with the help of <a href="#">Shahu of Kolhapur,</a> that is, Shahu IV (1874–1922).[40]</p>
            </div>
        </section>
        <p>Ambedkar went on to work as a legal professional. In 1926, he successfully defended three non-Brahmin leaders who had accused the Brahmin community of ruining India and were then subsequently sued for libel. Dhananjay Keer notes, "The victory was resounding, both socially and individually, for the clients and the doctor".[41]</p>

            <div class="about">
                <p>While practising law in the <a href="#">Bombay High Court,</a> he tried to promote education to untouchables and uplift them. His first organised attempt was his establishment of the central institution <a href="#">Bahishkrit Hitakarini Sabha,</a> intended to promote education and socio-economic improvement, as well as the welfare of "outcastes", at the time referred to as depressed classes.[42] For the defence of Dalit rights, he started many periodicals like Mook Nayak, Bahishkrit Bharat, and Equality Janta.[43]</p>
                <p>He was appointed to the Bombay Presidency Committee to work with the all-European <a href="#">Simon Commission</a> in 1925.[44] This commission had sparked great protests across India, and while its report was ignored by most Indians, Ambedkar himself wrote a separate set of recommendations for the future Constitution of India.[45]</p>

        <p>By 1927, Ambedkar had decided to launch active movements against <a href="#">untouchability.</a> He began with public movements and marches to open up public drinking water resources. He also began a struggle for the right to enter Hindu temples. He led a <a href="#">satyagraha in Mahad</a> to fight for the right of the untouchable community to draw water from the main water tank of the town.[46] In a conference in late 1927, Ambedkar publicly condemned the classic Hindu text, the Manusmriti (Laws of Manu), for ideologically justifying caste discrimination and "untouchability", and he ceremonially burned copies of the ancient text. On 25 December 1927, he led thousands of followers to burn copies of Manusmriti.[47][48] Thus annually 25 December is celebrated as Manusmriti Dahan Din (Manusmriti Burning Day) by <a href="#">Ambedkarites</a> and Dalits.[49][50]</p>
        <br>
        <p>In 1930, Ambedkar launched the <a href="#">Kalaram Temple movement</a> after three months of preparation. About 15,000 volunteers assembled at <a href="#">Kalaram Temple</a> satygraha making one of the greatest processions of <a href="#">Nashik.</a> The procession was headed by a military band and a batch of scouts; women and men walked with discipline, order and determination to see the god for the first time. When they reached the gates, the gates were closed by Brahmin authorities.[51]</p>

        <section class="flex">
            <div class="about">
                <p>In 1932, the British colonial government announced the formation of a separate electorate for "Depressed Classes" in the <a href="#">Communal Award.</a> Mahatma Gandhi fiercely opposed a separate electorate for untouchables, saying he feared that such an arrangement would divide the Hindu community.[52][53][54] Gandhi protested by fasting while imprisoned in the <a href="#">Yerwada Central Jail of Poona.</a> Following the fast, congressional politicians and activists such as <a href="#">Madan Mohan Malaviya and Palwankar</a> Baloo organised joint meetings with Ambedkar and his supporters at Yerwada.[55] On 25 September 1932, the agreement, known as the <a href="#">Poona Pact</a> was signed between Ambedkar (on behalf of the depressed classes among Hindus) and <a href="#">Madan Mohan Malaviya</a> (on behalf of the other Hindus). The agreement gave reserved seats for the depressed classes in the Provisional legislatures within the general electorate. Due to the pact the depressed class received 148 seats in the legislature instead of the 71, as allocated in the Communal Award proposed earlier by the colonial government under <a href="#">Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald.</a> The text used the term "Depressed Classes" to denote Untouchables among Hindus who were later called Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under the India Act 1935, and the later Indian Constitution of 1950.[56] In the Poona Pact, a unified electorate was in principle formed, but primary and secondary elections allowed Untouchables in practice to choose their own candidates.[57]</p>

                <p>In 1935, Ambedkar was appointed principal of the <a href="#">Government Law College, Bombay,</a> a position he held for two years. He also served as the chairman of Governing body of <a href="#">Ramjas College, University of Delhi,</a> after the death of its Founder Shri Rai Kedarnath.[58] Settling in Bombay (today called Mumbai), Ambedkar oversaw the construction of a house, and stocked his personal library with more than 50,000 books.[59] His wife Ramabai died after a long illness the same year. It had been her long-standing wish to go on a pilgrimage to <a href="#">Pandharpur,</a> but Ambedkar had refused to let her go, telling her that he would create a new Pandharpur for her instead of Hinduism's Pandharpur which treated them as untouchables. At the Yeola Conversion Conference on 13 October in Nasik, Ambedkar announced his intention to convert to a different religion and exhorted his followers to leave <a href="#">Hinduism.</a>[59] He would repeat his message at many public meetings across India.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In 1936, Ambedkar founded the <a href="#">Independent Labour Party,</a> which contested the 1937 Bombay election to the <a href="#">Central Legislative Assembly</a> for the 13 reserved and 4 general seats, and secured 11 and 3 seats respectively.[60]</p>

                <p>Ambedkar published his book <a href="#">Annihilation of Caste</a> on 15 May 1936.[61] It strongly criticised Hindu orthodox religious leaders and the caste system in general,[62] and included "a rebuke of Gandhi" on the subject.[63] Later, in a 1955 BBC interview, he accused Gandhi of writing in opposition of the caste system in English language papers while writing in support of it in Gujarati language papers.[64] In his writings, Ambedkar also accused <a href="#">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> of being "conscious of the fact that he is a <a href="#">Brahmin"</a>.[65]</p>
                <br>
                <p>During this time, Ambedkar also fought against the khoti system prevalent in Konkan, where khots, or government revenue collectors, regularly exploited farmers and tenants. In 1937, Ambedkar tabled a bill in the Bombay Legislative Assembly aimed at abolishing the khoti system by creating a direct relationship between government and farmers.[66]</p>

        <p>Ambedkar served on the Defence Advisory Committee[5] and the <a href="#">Viceroy's Executive Council as minister of labour</a>.[5] Before the <a href="#">Day of Deliverance</a> events, Ambedkar stated that he was interested in participating: "I read Mr. Jinnah's statement and I felt ashamed to have allowed him to steal a march over me and rob me of the language and the sentiment which I, more than Mr. Jinnah, was entitled to use." He went on to suggest that the communities he worked with were twenty times more oppressed by Congress policies than were Indian Muslims; he clarified that he was criticizing Congress, and not all Hindus.[67] Jinnah and Ambedkar jointly addressed the heavily attended Day of Deliverance event in <a href="#">Bhindi Bazaar</a>, Bombay, where both expressed "fiery" criticisms of the Congress party, and according to one observer, suggested that Islam and Hinduism were irreconcilable.[67][68]</p>
        <br>
        <p>In his work <a href="#">Who Were the Shudras?,</a> Ambedkar tried to explain the formation of untouchables. He saw Shudras and Ati Shudras who form the lowest caste in the ritual hierarchy of the <a href="#">caste system,</a> as separate from Untouchables. Ambedkar oversaw the transformation of his political party into the <a href="#">Scheduled Castes Federation</a>, although it performed poorly in the 1946 elections for <a href="#">Constituent Assembly of India.</a> Later he was elected into the constituent assembly of Bengal where Muslim League was in power.[2]</p>
        <br>
        <p>Ambedkar contested in the Bombay North first Indian General Election of 1952, but lost to his former assistant and Congress Party candidate Narayan Kajrolkar. Ambedkar became a member of <a href="#">Rajya Sabha,</a> probably an appointed member. He tried to enter <a href="#">Lok Sabha</a> again in the by-election of 1954 from Bhandara, but he placed third (the Congress Party won). By the time of the second general election in 1957, Ambedkar had died.</p>

        <p>Ambedkar was the first Indian to pursue a doctorate in economics abroad.[79] He argued that industrialisation and agricultural growth could enhance the Indian economy.[80] He stressed investment in agriculture as the primary industry of India.[citation needed] Ambedkar advocated national economic and social development, stressing education, public hygiene, community health, residential facilities as the basic amenities.[80] His DSc thesis, The problem of the Rupee: Its Origin and Solution (1923) examines the causes for the Rupee's fall in value. In this dissertation, he argued in favour of a gold standard in modified form, and was opposed to the gold-exchange standard favoured by Keynes in his treatise Indian Currency and Finance (1909), claiming it was less stable. He favoured the stoppage of all further coinage of the rupee and the minting of a gold coin, which he believed would fix currency rates and prices.[81]</p>
        <br>
        <p>Ambedkar opposed income tax for low-income groups. He contributed in Land Revenue Tax and excise duty policies to stabilise the economy.[citation needed] He played an important role in land reform and the state economic development.[citation needed] According to him, the caste system, due to its division of labourers and hierarchical nature, impedes movement of labour (higher castes would not do lower-caste occupations) and movement of capital (assuming investors would invest first in their own caste occupation). His theory of State Socialism had three points: state ownership of agricultural land, the maintenance of resources for production by the state, and a just distribution of these resources to the population. He emphasised a free economy with a stable Rupee which India has adopted recently.[citation needed] He advocated birth control to develop the Indian economy, and this has been adopted by Indian government as national policy for family planning. He emphasised equal rights for women for economic development.[citation needed]</p>
        <br>
        <p>A number of Ambedkar's ideas reflected deep interest in Austrian school of economics. The ideas of Ambedkar were close to those of Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, and William Graham Sumner. Ambedkar's theory of free banking was built on Menger's work and also on Gopal Krishna Gokhale's treatise on finance and money. Ambedkar's view about distinguishing differential quality of money was influenced by Menger's idea of sale-ability of money which is found in Menger's article 'On the Origin of Money'. Ambedkar's recommendations for free banking were ignored by both Royal Commission and Indian government.[84]</p>

                <p>Ambedkar's first wife <a href="#">Ramabai</a> died in 1935 after a long illness. After completing the draft of India's constitution in the late 1940s, he suffered from lack of sleep, had <a href="#">neuropathic pain</a> in his legs, and was taking insulin and <a href="#">homoeopathic medicines.</a> He went to Bombay for treatment, and there met <a href="#">Sharada Kabir,</a> whom he married on 15 April 1948, at his home in New Delhi. Doctors recommended a companion who was a good cook and had medical knowledge to care for him.[88] She adopted the name <a href="#">Savita Ambedkar</a> and cared for him the rest of his life.[89] Savita Ambedkar, who was called also 'Mai', died on May 29, 2003, aged 93 in Mumbai.[90]</p>

                <p>Ambedkar considered converting to <a href="#">Sikhism</a>, which encouraged opposition to oppression and so appealed to leaders of scheduled castes. But after meeting with Sikh leaders, he concluded that he might get "second-rate" Sikh status.[91]</p>
                <br>
                <p>Instead, around 1950, he began devoting his attention to Buddhism and travelled to <a href="#">Ceylon</a> (now Sri Lanka) to attend a meeting of the World Fellowship of Buddhists.[92] While dedicating a new Buddhist vihara near Pune, Ambedkar announced he was writing a book on Buddhism, and that when it was finished, he would formally convert to Buddhism.[93] He twice visited Burma in 1954; the second time to attend the third conference of the World <a href="#">Fellowship of Buddhists in Rangoon.</a>[94] In 1955, he founded the Bharatiya Bauddha Mahasabha, or the Buddhist Society of India.[95] In 1956, he completed his final work, <a href="#">The Buddha and His Dhamma,</a> which was published posthumously.[95]</p>

                <p>Since 1948, Ambedkar had <a href="#">diabetes.</a> He remained in bed from June to October in 1954 due to medication side-effects and poor eyesight.[93] His health worsened during 1955. Three days after completing his final manuscript <a href="#">The Buddha and His Dhamma</a>, Ambedkar died in his sleep on 6 December 1956 at his home in Delhi.[98]</p>
                <br>
                <p>A Buddhist cremation was organised at Dadar <a href="#">Chowpatty</a> beach on 7 December,[99] attended by half a million grieving people.[100] A conversion program was organised on 16 December 1956,[101] so that cremation attendees were also converted to Buddhism at the same place.[101]</p>
                <br>
                <p>Ambedkar was survived by his second wife <a href="#">Savita Ambedkar</a> (known as Maisaheb Ambedkar), who died in 2003,[102] and his son <a href="#">Yashwant Ambedkar</a> (known as Bhaiyasaheb Ambedkar), who died in 1977.[103] Savita and Yashwant carried on the socio-religious movement started by B.

        <p>A number of unfinished typescripts and handwritten drafts were found among Ambedkar's notes and papers and gradually made available. Among these were <a href="#">Waiting for a Visa</a>, which probably dates from 1935 to 1936 and is an autobiographical work, and the Untouchables, or the Children of India's Ghetto, which refers to the census of 1951.[93]</p>
        <br>
        <p>A memorial for Ambedkar was established in his <a href="#">Delhi house at 26 Alipur Road</a>. His birthdate known as <a href="#">Ambedkar Jayanti</a> or Bhim Jayanti is observed as a public holiday in many Indian states. He was posthumously awarded India's highest civilian honour, the <a href="#">Bharat Ratna</a>, in 1990.[110]</p>

                <p>Ambedkar's legacy as a socio-political reformer had a deep effect on modern India.[113][114] In post-Independence India, his socio-political thought is respected across the political spectrum. His initiatives have influenced various spheres of life and transformed the way India today looks at socio-economic policies, education and <a href="#">affirmative action</a> through socio-economic and legal incentives. His reputation as a scholar led to his appointment as free India's first law minister, and chairman of the committee for drafting the constitution. He passionately believed in individual freedom and criticised caste society. His accusations of <a href="#">Hinduism</a> as being the foundation of the caste system made him controversial and unpopular among Hindus.[115] His conversion to Buddhism sparked a revival in interest in Buddhist philosophy in India and abroad.[116]</p>
                <br>
                <p>Many public institutions are named in his honour, and the <a href="#">Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar</a> International Airport in Nagpur, otherwise known as <a href="#">Sonegaon Airport. Dr. B. R. Ambedkar National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar, Ambedkar University Delhi</a> is also named in his honour.[117]</p>

                <p>Ambedkar was voted "the <a href="#">Greatest Indian"</a> since independence by a poll organised by History TV18 and <a href="#">CNN IBN,</a> ahead of Patel and Nehru, in 2012. Nearly 20 million votes were cast.[119] Due to his role in economics, <a href="#">Narendra Jadhav</a>, a notable Indian economist,[120] has said that Ambedkar was "the highest educated Indian economist of all times."<div 121="#"> Amartya Sen</div>
                <a href=""></a>, said that Ambedkar is "father of my economics", and "he was highly controversial figure in his home country, though it was not the reality. His contribution in the field of economics is marvelous and will be remembered forever."[122][123]</p>
                <br>
                <p>On 2 April 1967, an 3.66 metre (12 foot) tall bronze statue of Ambedkar was installed in the <a href="#">Parliament of India</a>. The statue, sculpted by B.V. Wagh, was unveiled by the then President of India, <a href="#">Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan</a>.[124][125][126] On 12 April 1990, a portrait of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar is put in the Central Hall of <a href="#">Parliament House</a>.[127][128][129] The portrait of Ambedkar, painted by Zeba Amrohawi, was unveiled by the then Prime Minister of India, V. P. Singh.[127] Another portrait of Ambedkar is put in the Parliamentary Museum and archives of the Parliament House.[130][131]</p>
